# Sanic
Small desktop game in a form of a 2D platformer.

In this game, the player controls Sanic in order to collect the rings scattered around the map. The final objective of the game is to reach the flag somewhere within the platforms. Although the rings do not affect whether the player will win the game or not, it will affect the final grade the player will receive. While the player is navigating through the platforms, the player will encounter many obstacles that will instantly kill the player on contact, forcing the player to start over from the beginning. For example, the snail and the spikes on the platforms will kill Sanic. In addition, falling off of the platforms will cause the player to fall into a pit of spikes.

The player will use the left arrow key to move Sanic left and the right arrow key to move Sanic right. To jump, the player could use both the up arrow key or the space bar.

The final grade that the player receives will depend on the number of coins that the player collects. The player only receives a grade once the player reaches the flag and wins the game. The grades corresponding to the number of coins collected are:

S: 50 coins
A: 40-49 coins
B: 30-39 coins
C: 20-29 coins
D: 10-19 coins
F: 0-9 coins
At start, the player can either view the instructions once again, play the game in normal mode, play the game in difficult mode, or play the game in expert mode ("zero" gravity mode).
